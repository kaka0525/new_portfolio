                          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                          <p>Flat Track Roller Derby is a fast-growing and exciting sport. It can also be utterly baffling for 
			     first-time spectators. As of 2016, the Women’s Flat Track Derby Association counted 381 
			     Full Member Leagues and 66 apprentice leagues. Active derby participants nationwide
			     are estimated in the tens of thousands. Only relatively small portions of derby
			     spectators are aware of the rules and subtle tactical intricacies of the sport.
			     While there is a “rules” app for referees and coaches, a “minimum skills” app for novice
			     participants, and penalty timer apps for those administering an event but <b>there are no 
			     apps for derby spectators</b>.
			 </p>
			 <p>The challenge was to solve that problem by designing a mobile application that <b>helps 
			    roller derby spectators understands what they are seeing and following the action</b>. 
			    The project was <b>focus on immersion, research, and first-time user flows</b>.

                    <div class="container">
                      <div class="row justify-content-center">
                        <div class="col-lg-8 mt-4 mb-4 mb-lg-0">
                          <h3>The Approach</h3>
                          <p>My lack of domain knowledge in roller derby meant I needed to <b>understand the nature of
			     the sport, pain points of novice spectators and how did spectators gain roller knowledge 
			     in the first place </b>quickly and throughly. During the research phase, I conducted market 
			     analysis on existing roller derby education app but then to discover currently there are 
			     no apps that target roller derby spectators.</p>
			  <p>To access our prospective users, I went to a roller derby event to <b>talk to fans, players
			     and referees</b>. This allowed me to quickly understand the challenges novice spectators 
			     faced when they first started watching the game. Since it was hard to find and identify 
			     spectators who were newbies, I brought a friend who had no previous knowledge of the sport
			     to the event. And I observed his reactions and frustrations he encountered when he watched 
			    his first roller derby game.
			  </p>
			  <p>Because roller derby is an international sport, I created a survey to understand roller
			     derby's subcultural ethos, attitude and their scope of interest of the game to see were 
			     users only interested in knowing more about the local roller derby scenes or the sport as 
			     a whole in a international level.

                          <h3>The Discovery</h3>
                          <p>Insights form our discovery work indicated since the sport is relatively new, the rules and 
			     the strategies change all the time. Often, even seasoned spectators and players do not know
			     all the rules and subtle tactical intricacies of the sport.
			  </p>
			  <p><b>Spectators mostly learnt about the rules and strategies of the sports from the word of
			     mouth</b>. For newbies who have no immediate connections with people who have previous roller 
			     derby knowledge, the learning curve was really steep when they first started watching the game.
			  </p>
			 <p>I also discovered that spectators watched both online and offline games where an app that
			    has <b>easy look up on concised explanation of the rules, strategies and plays </b>could help 
		            improve spectators understanding of the game drastically.

			  <p>To avoid feature-itis, I created a persona that closely resembles the interviewees and empathy
			     map to help me relate and understand the end users and see things from their perspectives. 
			  </p>
			  <p>Before starting any design, I spent my time to figure out the userflows and requirements of 
			     the application. This involved creating a UX strategy blueprint that captures the goals and 
			     vision that I had with the proposed solution and  a feature matrix document to select the key 
			     features to implement on the app. And based on the workflows, I used Sketch to <b>create sets
			     of mid-fidelity prototypes to test my assumptions via InVision</b>.

                          <h3>Verifying</h3>
			  <p>To test the usability of the new derby app, I conducted <b>remote usability test </b>and recruited
			     multiple novice roller derby spectators to validate user behavior assumptions and 
			     identify potential design concerns in order to improve the end-user satisfaction.
			  </p>
			  <p>The test goals are the following</p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Evaluate the usability and flow of the app</li>
				<li>Identify the pain points participants have when they are using the app</li>
				<li>Determine how difficult is it for first time user to understand the navigation of the app </li>
				<li>Observe user’s understanding of the tool</li>
				<li>Analyze the improvement rate in the ability of a novice spectator to track and grasp the progress of a match after using the prototype</li>
			  </ul>
			 <p>Besides testing each tester’s ability to complete specific assigned tasks, the goal of the app is to
			    improve novice spectator understanding of the sport and help them track and grasp the progress of a match. 
			    To test the improvement the app brought to the spectators, I showed them a video of a bout and asked them 
			    to respond to a few roller derby related questions without the help of the app. After the first showing
			    of the video clip, I then provided them my prototype to use while watching the same roller derby video 
			    once more and observed any improvement on their understanding of the progress of the game.
			 </p>
			 <p>Overall, the testing went very well. Before using the prototype, users got ≅1 question correct.
			 <b> After using the prototype, 90% of the users got all the questions right.</b> The test completion rate 
			 was over 90%. Users thought the UI of the new feature is familiar and consistent with the current user 
			 interface of the other sport apps and they thought the user flow is smooth and intuitive.

                          <h3>UI Design</h3>
			  <p>After I went through a few rounds of wireframe iterations based on user testing results and feedback.
			     I moved on to exploring Derby Power's identity. I created a mood board based on how users describe
			     the sport during the research. The keywords that appeared the most during the interviews and survey 
			     were: <b>alternative</b>, <b>inclusive</b>, <b>diverse</b>, <b>welcoming</b> and <b>bold</b>.
			  </p>
			  <p>The designs used pink gradient as the dominant color with a few color accents to bring out the clean 
			     and bold interace. The color choices used are vibrant and eye-catching, which represents the sport is 
			     special and authetic.
			  </p>
			  <p>For the logo, I developed a mascot for the brand: Derby, a unicorn that skates. I decided to
			     use <b>unicorn because it symbolizes the uniqueness and athleticism of the sport</b>. And
			     the <b>rainbow represents the inclusive community the sport brings</b>.

                          <h2><b>Problem Solving</b></h2>
                          <p>With the increasing number of participants joining the program in the foreseeable future, there are three design questions that helped shape my design strategy.</p>
                          <p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>One of the constraints of the program is that there are far more mentees than mentors. If a mentee is no longer meeting up with his or her mentor on a regular basis, we would like the mentee to notify the program so that the mentor can be freed to mentor a new mentee.</li>
                              <li>The new mentoring pairing model will depend heavily on mentee self-selection; how much of a mentor’s information should we display on the online profile before a pairing is made?</li>
                              <li>How to create a smooth notification process for users when there there is a mismatch?</li>
                            </ol>
                          </p>
                          <p>After some brainstorming and research, I proposed four key feature ideas: <b>Hassle-free reassignment</b>, <b>Mentorship Pause</b>, <b>periodic status check-in</b> and <b>progressive personal information disclosure</b> to better streamline the overall administrative process and protect the privacy of mentors. Central to the features were these key ideas:</p>

                              <h3>Hassle-free Reassignment</h3>
                              <p>Even with the best effort to find the perfect match, a mismatch between a mentor and mentee can occur. The mismatch may result from difference in areas of expertise, career goals, conflicting personalities, or any number of other reasons. Given the unsuited pair took the first course of action and discussed openly with each other about the issue at hand and they both believe that a switch is desirable. Mentees can discontinue the pairing  on the app  and administrators will subsequently be notified and step in  as a mediators to resolve  disputes and  help mentees to identify a more appropriate mentor if desired. Furthermore, administrators will gather useful information on both the mentors and mentees to help improve match suggestions if needed in the future.</p>

                            <b>Mentor Scarcity</b>
                              <p>Mentors are a scarce resource and individuals who have agreed to be mentors have a strong commitment to the process. Throughout the mentorship, mentors and mentees are given the discretion to decide on the mentorship arrangements and meetings. While no specific rules are in place, mentors and mentees are encourage to meet on a regular basis. We want to avoid situations where mentors become an idle resource.  Every mentorship will naturally taper off  over time- but not end. One thing we have to design for is to adequately identify mentees who are not actively meeting their mentors so the system will be updated and  mentor’s valuable time can be reallocated so more mentees can benefit from their knowledge in the community. And to do so, we need to design to enable  mentees to notify the program when their mentorship is stagnated.</p>
                              <p>Though this might sound like an easy step, the are a few potential roadblocks: 1)  Feature discovery  2) encouragement/Incentives for mentees to use the feature.</p>
                              <p>Initially, the team decided to reuse the “Discontinue Pairing button” for the purpose of enabling  mentees to notify PuPPy that the mentorship has be paused. But after some debates, I recognize it is important to distinguish and break down the inactive mentorship notification functionalities into a more discrete non-overlapping functions with the discontinue button.</p>
                              <p>The reasons for the decision is unlike the discontinuing pairing function, which is usually used in early stage of paring: when a mismatch is discovered by mentor, the mentee, or both and volunteers. Once clicked, administrators will be notified and step in to mediate and resolve the conflict at hand and help mentees to seek for a new suited mentor. In addition to that, the verbiage “Discontinuing pairing” might discourage and deter mentees from using the feature when they  have amicable relationships with their mentors.To overcome these roadblocks, I designed the <b>pausing mentionship feature</b> that allows mentees to inform PuPPy that their mentorship is inactive.</p>

                                  <p>Once users successfully paired with a mentor, I use tooltips as an onboarding mechanism to grab users attention and give users a brief overview of the Pause mentorship and Discontinue pairing features.</p>
                                  <p>The tooltip messages are short and concise and they provide users information in a friendly and unobtrusive way. The result aims to be educational rather than unnecessarily disruptive. They help take some of the guesswork out on the button functions.</p>

                                   <p>Besides the feature tour to guide users through the mentee profile page,  it is essential to have periodic status check in with mentees every three months to have the latest updates of their mentorship statuses. I believe that such handholding and guidance is necessary for effective mentoring to occur. The automatic prompts serve as a reminders on the possible overlooked feature and encourage mentees to check on the progress of the mentoring session and take actions accordingly. The tooltips language  are  designed to have a personal, human tone to get users to pay attention and take action.</p>

                                  <h3>Incentivize lifelong mentorship</h3>
                                   <p>It is natural that an existing mentorship enter the maintenance phase. Another way to promote users to notify the program when the mentorship is inactive is to provide incentives. Since we have a limited mentors, all mentees can only be paired with one mentor. And it is common that the challenges the mentees face when they are starting out are different from what they face 2 to  3 years in the industry. Later in the career, mentees might want  to seek out different mentors to expand their network or get a fresh perspective and guidance.</p>
                                  <p>If a mentee already been assigned to a mentor and wants to initiate new match, we provide a pop up that is shown explaining the new pairing request is prohibited. There is information that inform them that  all mentees can only be assigned to one mentor. In order for them to request a different mentor, they have to pause on the current pairing before they can proceed with the new mentor request. The popup helps users to be accustomed to the idea of “pausing a pairing” and minimize user’s frustration.  And mentees are encouraged  to maintain connections with previous mentors who they can turn to when desired.</p>

                            <h3>Progressive Personal Information Disclosure</h3>
                            <p>The PuPPy matching process will focus on self selection. It raised the question on how much information to display when mentee is browsing through mentor’s profiles. The application takes privacy very seriously . Before the match, only mentor’s usernames, expertise, introduction are displayed. It does not release the mentor’s full name, slack handler, e-mail information until mentors accept the match request.</p>

                            <p>It was incredibly meaningful and rewarding to examine the mentorship experience and create an open source solution that helps the tech community to implement their mentorship program. This project is close to my heart because I  graduated from a coding bootcamp several years ago. I remember vividly the frustration and nerves I experienced when I was starting out in the tech industry.  It was the formal and informal mentoring I received from the community that has enriched me on a personal and professional level.</p>
                            <p>Designing the application pushed me to consider many facets beyond the core functionality. The project has got me thinking to design when there is a budget constraints. Image hosting services and photo storage is quite expensive for organizations that is short in funding. To combat that without sacrificing on the user experience, I designed a text-only version design that do not use profile pictures.</p>
                            <p>Besides It has given me the opportunity to not only touch upon some basic user research and I was able to take the project to any early prototyping stage, giving me a chance to not only work in a group setting, but also the whole design process. Designing for PuPPy mentorship  was a successful  project in more ways than just a completed mobile experience. It also allowed me to be part of the effort that help foster mentorship in the community and allow me to express my gratitude and repay on the  embarrassing amount of free 🍕 I have had in their meetings.</p>
