                     <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As F5 Networks strives to improve its product quality standards, it pushes the organization to  optimize test coverage. A lot of relatively unknown testing frameworks that have had a successful track record started to attract more attention. Often times, the soon-to-be expand test environment are headless; they lack a robust, impactful front-end that is ready for a wider audience who are not familiar with the framework to interact with and gain immediately insights from.</p>
                <p>Carrier, is the up-and-coming testing framework/latest test framework that is in need to establish a broad frontend capability to meet new business needs. I was tasked to design and build the Carrier Graphical User Interface within the existing backend in an effort to help expand its test scope.

                          <p>Our goal for the project is to build a test management tool to onboard a wider audience to Carrier, the soon-to-expand scalable testing framework. Our ambition is to develop new process, design and standards, which other vertical teams can follow when they are expanding their infrastructure tools.</p>

                          <p><b>Our high level goals were to:</b>
                          </p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>
                              Simplify test information into more understandable pieces that allows users to gain quick insights and overview on the test framework
                              </li>
                              <li>
                              Build an effective communication system that allows other teams to integrating and run their test cases in Carrier.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                              Create a platform that enables Carrier to continuously expand its reach and test scopes.

                          <h2><b>Research</b></h2>
                          <p>To understand the problem domain, project scope, and opportunities at a high level, I conducted interviews with stakeholders to comprehend  the wider business priorities, pain points and long-term strategies.</p>
                          <p>I shadowed Carrier test engineers when they were performing their daily tasks to get a better grasp of the existing process. And from the interviews and shadowing, I documented what are some areas of improvement and observed where do the pain points and frustrations lie.</p>
                          <p>From the user research, I discovered the following: </p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Carrier testing environment is a black box in the eyes of the people who are not within the immediate team. It relies heavily on the tribal knowledge of the 2 Carrier test engineers to interpret its test results to the extent that even a simple pass and fail requires manpower to decipher.</li>
                            <li>The ability to quickly identify the real-time status and test configuration (test build and branch) of the environment is deemed highly desirable.</li>
                            <li>Ability to find Carrier’s latest status on test scope expansion plan is noted to be an important factor to keep all teams align.</li>
                            <li>The test expansion process is anxiety inducing for Carrier engineers. They worried the incoming new tests proposals from other teams do not have enough of the understanding in the environment to provide the necessary information (conditions or configurations)  that is needed to set up for the new automation or worst affecting the results of the existing tests.
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>With data representation being the backbone of the product, I planned and prioritized strategically on what contextual data are critical to show users on  the 1st phase of the project and investigate on how information flows across organization. </p>
                          <p>By doing so, it allows me to focus on exploring different solutions on representing data in an easy to follow and engaging way. And decided what addition data might be useful for later updates.</p>
                          <p>I presented sketches in weekly sync ups to stakeholders to assure the design reflect the changes that we discussed and actively obtain regular feedback and input to expose gaps in requirements and flow. Once we agreed on the product features solution, I translated the concepts into fully functional interactive prototype in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Testing is done throughout the whole project cycle to validate the concept and I iterated rapidly to discover the optimal user experience to ensure the information architecture of the web portal is effective.</p>

                          <p>The purpose of the tool is to to help the test framework expand by ensuring the design present information in an effective and intuitive format that makes sense to the audience. Hence, empowering teams to work more productively and efficiently. The design principle is to inform with a glance without the need of additional training. I used familiar design patterns so users don’t need to analyze each interaction to navigate through the tool.</p>

It is rare that some of your end users are only a few desks away and you get immediate feedback and high fives <i class="em em-raising_hand"></i> when you make significant feedback that improve their daily work flow.</p>
                          <p>One of the key learnings from my experience in building enterprise internal infrastructure tools is that feature requests come thick and fast. This often means there are plenty of solution suggestions. It is important to take a step back from time to time to narrowly and properly defined the problem and create solutions that get to the heart of the problem that we are trying to solve.</p>

                          <p>The purpose of the tool is to to help the test framework expand by ensuring the design present information in an effective and intuitive format that makes sense to the audience. Hence, empowering teams to work more productively and efficiently. The design principle is to inform with a glance without the need of additional training. I used familiar design patterns so users don’t need to analyze each interaction to navigate through the tool.</p>

                            <h3>Real time insights of the test environment</h3>
                            <p>A key design challenge was to consider how to illustrate continuous testing data. I opted for the gantt chart inspired design to lists all the test cases that are scheduled and performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity. The dynamic timeline depicts the status/state of individual tests with a glance, which users can easily  get real-time insights on the testing process and easily track statuses of individual tests.</p>

                                   <p>It is natural that an existing mentorship enter the maintenance phase. Another way to promote users to notify the program when the mentorship is inactive is to provide incentives. Since we have a limited mentors, all mentees can only be paired with one mentor. And it is common that the challenges the mentees face when they are starting out are different from what they face 2 to  3 years in the industry. Later in the career, mentees might want  to seek out different mentors to expand their network or get a fresh perspective and guidance.</p>
                                  <p>If a mentee already been assigned to a mentor and wants to initiate new match, we provide a pop up that is shown explaining the new pairing request is prohibited. There is information that inform them that  all mentees can only be assigned to one mentor. In order for them to request a different mentor, they have to pause on the current pairing before they can proceed with the new mentor request. The popup helps users to be accustomed to the idea of “pausing a pairing” and minimize user’s frustration.  And mentees are encouraged  to maintain connections with previous mentors who they can turn to when desired.</p>

                            <p>The PuPPy matching process will focus on self selection. It raised the question on how much information to display when mentee is browsing through mentor’s profiles. The application takes privacy very seriously . Before the match, only mentor’s usernames, expertise, introduction are displayed. It does not release the mentor’s full name, slack handler, e-mail information until mentors accept the match request.</p>

It was the formal and informal mentoring I received from the community that has enriched me on a personal and professional level.</p>
