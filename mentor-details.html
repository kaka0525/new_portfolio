                     <p>Puget Sound Python Programming (PuPPy) is a user group dedicated to proliferating a diverse and talented Python community in the Puget Sound region. Its mentorship program was founded to connect aspiring developers with experienced members in the tech industry.</p>
                     <p>In 2018, I participated in a hackathon to design an open source, responsive web application to automate the administrative tasks of the mentorship program in the interest of scaling and sustaining its success.</p>

                          <h2><b>The Challenge</b></h2>
                          <p>Previously, managing the PuPPy mentoring program has been a time-consuming and low-tech task. It involved manually reading through Google Forms, updating Google Sheets and sending numerous emails. The tedious work has contributed to the high turnover rate of volunteers and it has become burdensome for veterans to keep training new volunteers about the system.</p>
                          <p>The program owner now seeks help to build a responsive web application that streamlines the administrative tasks in hopes to alleviate the workload. The open source project strives to become a tool, which any tech community can use to start and manage their mentorship programs.</p>
                          <p><b>The high level goals were to:</b>
                          </p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>
                              Create an open source platform to help organizations to facilitate and start their mentorship programs effectively.
                              </li>

                              Grow a community dedicated to helping early-career software developers overcome the
                              challenges of starting their new professions.

                          <p>At the outset of the project, I conducted stakeholder interviews with the project owner to discuss the project vision, and define the success metrics.

                          <h2><b>Market Research/ Competitive Analysis</b></h2>
                          <p>After gathering insights from stakeholders, I began to analyze the UI patterns and mentor matching process solutions from competitors. From the research, I learnt that there are two common ways mentors and mentees are matched.</p>
                          <p>The most popular, also PuPPy’s pre-existing method is assignment. This experience was to do the heavy lifting on behalf of the mentees; volunteers manually sort through mentee’s applications and assigned mentors based on their preferences, skill sets and characteristics.</p>
                          <p>The second method is self-selection where mentees can browse and dive into mentor’s profiles, request to match with the people based on their needs. The new application will adopt this method, where we assert control back to the users on the mentor selection process thus minimizing administrative loads of volunteers.</p>
                          <p>Administrator roles will change from primary to ancillary. They will provide suggestions if mentees struggle to seek the appropriate match. And with the new structure, they will focus on overseeing the overall program operations and act as mediators to resolve conflicts between mentors and mentors  when they arise.</p>

                          <h2><b>Problem Solving</b></h2>
                          <p>With the increasing number of participants joining the program in the foreseeable future, there are three design questions that helped shape my design strategy.</p>
                          <p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>One of the constraints of the program is that there are far more mentees than mentors. If a mentee is no longer meeting up with his or her mentor on a regular basis, we would like the mentee to notify the program so that the mentor can be freed to mentor a new mentee.</li>
                              <li>The new mentoring pairing model will depend heavily on mentee self-selection; how much of a mentor’s information should we display on the online profile before a pairing is made?</li>
                              <li>How to create a smooth notification process for users when there there is a mismatch?</li>
                            </ol>
                          </p>
                          <p>After some brainstorming and research, I proposed four key feature ideas: <b>Hassle-free reassignment</b>, <b>Mentorship Pause</b>, <b>periodic status check-in</b> and <b>progressive personal information disclosure</b> to better streamline the overall administrative process and protect the privacy of mentors. Central to the features were these key ideas:</p>

                              <h3>Hassle-free Reassignment</h3>
                              <p>Even with the best effort to find the perfect match, a mismatch between a mentor and mentee can occur. The mismatch may result from difference in areas of expertise, career goals, conflicting personalities, or any number of other reasons.</p>
                              <p>Given the unsuited pair took the first course of action and discussed openly with each other about the issue at hand and they both believe that a switch is desirable. Mentees can discontinue the pairing  on the app  and administrators will subsequently be notified and step in  as a mediators to resolve  disputes and help mentees to identify a more appropriate mentor if desired. Furthermore, administrators will gather useful information on both the mentors and mentees to help improve match suggestions if needed in the future.</p>

                            <b>Mentor Scarcity</b>
                              <p>Mentors are a scarce resource and individuals who have agreed to be mentors have a strong commitment to the process. Throughout the mentorship, mentors and mentees are given the discretion to decide on the mentorship arrangements and meetings. While no specific rules are in place, mentors and mentees are encourage to meet on a regular basis. We want to avoid situations where mentors become an idle resource.  Every mentorship will naturally taper off  over time- but not end. One thing we have to design for is to adequately identify mentees who are not actively meeting their mentors so the system will be updated and  mentor’s valuable time can be reallocated so more mentees can benefit from their knowledge in the community. And to do so, we need to design to enable  mentees to notify the program when their mentorship is stagnated.</p>
                              <p>Though this might sound like an easy step, the are a few potential roadblocks: 1)  Feature discovery  2) encouragement/Incentives for mentees to use the feature.</p>
                              <p>Initially, the team decided to reuse the “Discontinue Pairing button” for the purpose of enabling  mentees to notify PuPPy that the mentorship has be paused. But after some debates, I recognize it is important to distinguish and break down the inactive mentorship notification functionalities into a more discrete non-overlapping functions with the discontinue button.</p>
                              <p>The reasons for the decision is unlike the discontinuing pairing function, which is usually used in early stage of paring: when a mismatch is discovered by mentor, the mentee, or both and volunteers. Once clicked, administrators will be notified and step in to mediate and resolve the conflict at hand and help mentees to seek for a new suited mentor. In addition to that, the verbiage “Discontinuing pairing” might discourage and deter mentees from using the feature when they  have amicable relationships with their mentors.To overcome these roadblocks, I designed the <b>pausing mentionship feature</b> that allows mentees to inform PuPPy that their mentorship is inactive.</p>

                                  <p>Once users successfully paired with a mentor, I use tooltips as an onboarding mechanism to grab users attention and give users a brief overview of the Pause mentorship and Discontinue pairing features.</p>
                                  <p>The tooltip messages are short and concise and they provide users information in a friendly and unobtrusive way. The result aims to be educational rather than unnecessarily disruptive. They help take some of the guesswork out on the button functions.</p>

                                   <p>Besides the feature tour to guide users through the mentee profile page,  it is essential to have periodic status check in with mentees every three months to have the latest updates of their mentorship statuses. I believe that such handholding and guidance is necessary for effective mentoring to occur. The automatic prompts serve as a reminders on the possible overlooked feature and encourage mentees to check on the progress of the mentoring session and take actions accordingly. The tooltips language  are  designed to have a personal, human tone to get users to pay attention and take action.</p>

                                  <h3>Incentivize lifelong mentorship</h3>
                                   <p>It is natural that an existing mentorship enter the maintenance phase. Another way to promote users to notify the program when the mentorship is inactive is to provide incentives. Since we have a limited mentors, all mentees can only be paired with one mentor. And it is common that the challenges the mentees face when they are starting out are different from what they face 2 to  3 years in the industry. Later in the career, mentees might want  to seek out different mentors to expand their network or get a fresh perspective and guidance.</p>
                                  <p>If a mentee already been assigned to a mentor and wants to initiate new match, we provide a pop up that is shown explaining the new pairing request is prohibited. There is information that inform them that  all mentees can only be assigned to one mentor. In order for them to request a different mentor, they have to pause on the current pairing before they can proceed with the new mentor request. The popup helps users to be accustomed to the idea of “pausing a pairing” and minimize user’s frustration.  And mentees are encouraged  to maintain connections with previous mentors who they can turn to when desired.</p>

                            <p>The PuPPy matching process will focus on self selection. It raised the question on how much information to display when mentee is browsing through mentor’s profiles. The application takes privacy very seriously . Before the match, only mentor’s usernames, expertise, introduction are displayed. It does not release the mentor’s full name, slack handler, e-mail information until mentors accept the match request.</p>

                            <p>It was incredibly meaningful and rewarding to design an open source solution that helps the tech community to implement and scale their mentorship programs. This project is especially close to my heart because I graduated from a coding bootcamp several years ago. I remember vividly the frustration and nerves I experienced when I was starting out in the tech industry.  And it was the formal and informal mentoring I received from the community that has enriched me on a personal and professional level that help me along the way.</p>
                            <p>Designing the application pushed me to examine many facets beyond the core functionality of a mentorship program. The project made me think on designing with a budget constraint in mind  given that my work experience had been working mostly with well-funded companies. Image hosting services are quite expensive for non-profit organizations. To combat that without sacrificing on the user experience, I designed a text-only version design that do not use profile pictures to save on cost on photo storage services for groups that are short of funds.</p>
                            <p>Besides It has given the opportunity to not only touch upon some basic user research and I was able to take the project from an early prototyping stage, giving me a chance to not only work in a group setting, but also the whole design process. Designing for PuPPy mentorship  was a successful  project in more ways than just a completed mobile experience. It  allowed me to be part of the effort that help foster mentorship in the community and provide a mean for me  to express my gratitude on the  embarrassing amount of free pizzas <i class="em em-pizza"></i> I have had in their meetings.</p>
