           <p>As F5 Networks strove to improve its product quality standards, it
              pushed the organization to optimize test coverage. A lot of relatively unknown testing frameworks that had a successful track record started to attract more attention. Often times, the soon-to-be expanded test environments were headless; they lacked a robust, impactful front-end that was ready for a wider audience who were not familiar with the framework to interact with and gain immediately insights from.</p>
            <p>Carrier was the latest test framework that was in need to establish a broad frontend capability to meet new business needs. I was tasked to design and build the Carrier
            Graphical User Interface within the existing backend in an effort to
            help expand its test scope.</p>

          <p>Our goal for the project was to build a test management tool to onboard more engineers and project managers to Carrier, the soon-to-expand scalable testing framework. Our ambition was to develop new process, design and standards, which other vertical teams can follow when they are expanding their infrastructure tools.</p>
          <p><b>Our high level goals were to:</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Simplify test information into more understandable pieces that allows users to gain quick insights about test suites that have run.</li>
            <li>Build a collaborative system that allows other teams to
            integrate their test cases in Carrier.</li>

          <h2><b>Research</b></h2>
          <p>To understand the problem domain, project scope, and opportunities at a high level, I conducted interviews with stakeholders to comprehend the wider business priorities, pain points and long-term strategies.</p>
          <p>I shadowed Carrier test engineers when they were performing their dailytasks to get a better grasp of the existing process. And from the
          interviews and shadowing, I documented what are some areas of improvement and observed where do the pain points and frustrations lie.</p>
          <p>From the user research, I discovered the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Carrier testing environment is a black box in the eyes of the people
            who are not within the immediate team. It relies heavily on the tribal
            knowledge of the two Carrier test engineers to interpret its test results
            to the extent that even a simple pass and fail requires manpower to
            decipher.</li>
            <li>The ability to quickly identify the real-time status and test
            configuration (test build and branch) of the environment is deemed highly
            desirable.</li>
            <li>Ability to find Carrier’s latest status on test scope expansion plan
            is noted to be an important factor to keep all teams align.</li>
            <li>
              <!-- Unclear that at this point, this is a hypothetical worry about "new test proposals" -->
              The test expansion process is anxiety-inducing for Carrier engineers.

          partnered up with a Project Manager on prioritizing feature requests,
          personas’ needs, business objectives and tech feasibility against each

          <h2><b>Ideation</b></h2>
          <p>With data representation being the backbone of the product, I planned
          and prioritized strategically on what contextual data are critical to show
          users on the 1st phase of the project and investigated how information
          flows across the organization.</p>
          <p>By doing so, it allowed me to focus for exploring different solutions on
          representing data in an easy to follow and engaging way, and decided what
          additional data might be useful for later updates.</p>
          <p>I presented sketches in weekly sync ups to stakeholders to assure the
          design reflects the changes that we discussed and actively obtained regular
          feedback and input to expose gaps in requirements and flow. Once we agreed
          on the product features solution, I translated the concepts into fully
          functional interactive prototype in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Usability testing is
          done throughout the whole project cycle to validate the concept and I
          iterated rapidly to discover the optimal user experience to ensure the
          information architecture of the web portal is effective.</p>

          <h2><b>Solution</b></h2>
          <p>The purpose of the tool is to help the test framework expand by
          ensuring the design presents information in an effective and intuitive
          format that makes sense to the audience. Hence, empowering teams to work
          more productively and efficiently. The design principle is to inform with
          a glance without the need of additional training. I used familiar design
          patterns so users don’t need to analyze each interaction to navigate
          through the tool.</p>
          <section>
            <h3>Real time insights of the test environment</h3>
            <p>A key design challenge was to consider how to illustrate continuous
            testing data. I opted for the gantt chart inspired design to lists all
            the test cases that are scheduled and performed on the vertical axis, and
            time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars
            in the graph shows the duration of each activity. The dynamic timeline
            depicts the status/state of individual tests with a glance, so users
            can easily get real-time insights on the testing process and easily track
            statuses of individual tests.</p>

                  results in an easily understandable format. Users can zoom-in-to reveal the results broken down by the test branch and build in easy to

                  <p>The new test  management page helps project managers to stay up-to-date on all test proposals. For test requesters, they can use the tool to set deadlines and priorities to ensure the new test automation will get done on time. And Carrier Engineers can communicate and delegate the subtasks to the test requester if there is any missing  information they need to set up for the new automation. In addition, the tool helps them plan their time and meet deadlines without the need to search through emails and notes for to-dos.</p>

                  <p>The task board supports the classic CRUD operations, which permit users and to create, read, update and delete test proposals statuses accordingly.

                  <p>It has been incredible to see the solution I’ve developed improve the
                  daily lives of my colleagues and help enhance the underlying performance
                  of our product. It is rare that some of your end users are only a few
                  desks away and you get immediate feedback and high fives <i class=
                  "em em-raising_hand"></i> when you make significant feedback that improve
                  their daily work flow.</p>
                  <p>One of the key learnings from my experience in building enterprise
                  internal infrastructure tools is that feature requests come thick and
                  fast. This often means there are plenty of solution suggestions. It is
                  important to take a step back from time to time to narrowly and properly
                  define the issue and create solutions that get to the heart of the problem that we are trying to solve.</p>
